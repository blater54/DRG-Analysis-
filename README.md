## What‚Äôs This Project About?  
Hospitals bill one amount for patient care‚Ä¶ but Medicare doesn‚Äôt always pay anywhere close to that.  
This project digs into **CMS Medicare Inpatient Hospital data** to find:  
- Which **conditions (DRGs)** are costing hospitals the most money  
- Which **states** are feeling the biggest pinch  
- How much hospitals are *really* losing per patient on average

## The Data  
- **Source**: [CMS Medicare Inpatient Hospitals ‚Äì By Provider and Service](https://data.cms.gov/provider-summary-by-type-of-service/medicare-inpatient-hospitals/medicare-inpatient-hospitals-by-provider-and-service/data)  
- **Level**: Hospital + DRG (Diagnosis Related Group)  
- **Key Columns**:  
  - `Total Discharges` ‚Äì patient count  
  - `Average Covered Charges` ‚Äì what the hospital billed  
  - `Average Medicare Payments` ‚Äì what Medicare actually paid  
  - `Average Total Payments` ‚Äì includes Medicare + patient + other insurance  

---

## What I Looked At  
**KPIs in the dashboard**:  
- Total discharges  
- Average covered charges (billed amount)  
- Average Medicare payments (reimbursement)  
- Loss per discharge *(covered charges ‚àí Medicare payments)*  
- Total loss per DRG and per state  

---

## Key Takeaways  
### 1. States hit hardest  
- **California, Texas, Florida** ‚Üí biggest *total* losses (high volume of Medicare patients)  
- **Alaska** ‚Üí highest *loss per patient* (care costs are much higher there)  

### 2. DRGs with the biggest gaps  
- Complex surgeries and high-acuity cases make up most of the **top 5 loss DRGs**.  
- Medicare covers **only ~15‚Äì25%** of the hospital‚Äôs bill for these DRGs.  

### 3. Geography matters  
- States with higher living costs (Alaska, Hawaii) bill much more per patient.  
- Medicare rates don‚Äôt adjust enough to match those costs ‚Üí bigger losses.

## Why It Matters  
If you work in hospital finance or operations, this dashboard helps you:  
1. Spot **high-volume states** where small changes can save millions.  
2. Identify **high-cost states** that might need operational or policy review.  
3. Target **loss-heavy DRGs** for process improvements or reimbursement negotiations.
